# DeepFashion

The inspiration of starting this project came from the passion I have for Technolegy & Fashion.
The idea was to create an image classification with data that I have intrest in (my own clothes).
My goal of this project is to create an accurate image classifier using images of clothes from my own closet,
in order to challenge myself and deal with real life data problems.

# Dataset 
The dataset consists of images of clothes from my own closet: 
            50 Tops
            50 Bottems
            26 shoes

All images were taken from a cellphone camera.
* In the near future I am about to add more images.

I moved the images to google drive in order to work with google colab (which enables to speed up the running time of the network with GPU).
I have separated the data into train and validation and kept it in the “train” and “validation” folders.
